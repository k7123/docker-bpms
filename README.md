# docker-bpms

Simple docker image to handle my BPMS build. This is by no means a production grade image, it's there to get something up fast. If you want help with Red Hat BPM Suite and Docker in production environment, [contact Red Hat Consulting](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/business-automation).

Built on [my base EAP image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sherl0cks/docker-eap/). Master will always reflect the latest GA release.

There is a provided default user, jboss, with password bpmsuite1!
